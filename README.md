# so-much.space

This repository contains the source code and content for my personal blog [so-much.space](https://www.so-much.space/).

Articles are written in Markdown and turned into a static website with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
Continous deployment and hosting are handled by Netlify's generous free offering.
