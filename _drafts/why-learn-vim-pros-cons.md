title: Why Learn (Neo)Vim?
---
Why bother learning a text editor that is anecdotally so hard to exit, that people just surrender and stick with it?

First lets get this out of the way.
If you're one of those poor souls that can't exit Vim read `:help quit`.
Also there's a Disclaimer:

I personally use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
The points of this post should stand for Vim nevertheless, to the best of my knowledge.
I also love it (this post is written in it). I'll try to give an unbiased view nevertheless.

<!-- TODO Inkdrop Liste Ã¼bernehmen -->
## What's awesome
* Vim is blazing fast
* Keep the home row
* One control scheme for all your editors
* Hjkl is standard (ghjk), vim (like) input is supported in a lot of places
* Regex Comapt
* Structured text
* sed compatible search & replace
* Build in documentation (?)
* Powerful buffer & split management (layout save)
* Extensible, Customizable
* Close to the terminal
  * Integrated, execute commands and read output
* Macros
* Non linear undo tree
* It's full of features. This list is a shallow overview at best, there's [way more](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/intermediate-vim/) (and again way more than that) to discover.

## Caveits
* Discoverability is not Vims strength (like... at all)
* Prerequisite blind typing
* Writer / developer
* Configuration takes *a lot* of time
* Learning takes some time
* Getting good takes more

## Result
Anyone that composes a lot of text (that includes source code) on a computer should try Vim.
You don't have to go through long hours of configuration.
You don't have to drop your favorite editor.\
Most IDEs and text editors have Vim bindings build in or available as a plugin, some examples include
[Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim),
[IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim), even
[Emacs](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil).
Vim like editing is available in a lot of desktop or web apps like Overleaf.
Vim like navigation is available in `less`, in some PDF readers like Okular, in Firefox & Chrome with [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/).
You can even navigate your system windows if you're using a tiling window manager.\
Learning Vim gives you a consistent and precise interface for editing text and for controlling your computer without a mouse.

Now how do you learn it? That's a topic for another post.
